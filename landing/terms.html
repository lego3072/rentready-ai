        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Condition Report website and service located at <a href="https://condition-report.com">condition-report.com</a> ("Service"), operated by DataWeaveAI INC ("Company", "we", "us", "our"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>Condition Report is an AI-powered property condition report generator. Users upload photographs of rooms or property areas, and the Service uses artificial intelligence to analyze visible conditions and generate a structured condition report in PDF format. The Service is designed for landlords, property managers, and tenants.</p>

        <h2>2. Important Disclaimer — Not a Professional Inspection</h2>
        <p><strong>The Service is not a substitute for a professional property inspection.</strong> AI analysis is based solely on visible conditions in uploaded photographs. The Service does not assess:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hidden defects behind walls, floors, or ceilings</li>
            <li>Structural integrity or foundation issues</li>
            <li>Mechanical, electrical, plumbing, or HVAC systems</li>
            <li>Environmental hazards (mold, asbestos, lead paint, radon)</li>
            <li>Code compliance or zoning issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Reports generated by the Service are informational tools to supplement — not replace — in-person inspections. We make no guarantee regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of AI-generated analysis. You should independently verify all findings.</p>

        <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
        <p>You may create an account to save reports and manage your subscription. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account. You must provide accurate information and be at least 18 years old to create an account.</p>

            <li><strong>Pro Annual</strong>: $249/year — unlimited condition reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A free trial (one report) is available to demonstrate the Service's capabilities. After the free trial, payment is required to download, email, text, or share reports.</p>
        <p>Payments are processed securely by Stripe. Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled. You may cancel your subscription at any time; access continues until the end of the current billing period.

        <p>You represent that you have the right to upload the photographs you submit and that they do not violate any third party's rights.</p>

        <h2>6. AI Processing</h2>
        <p>Uploaded photographs are sent to third-party AI services (Anthropic's Claude API) for analysis. By using the Service, you consent to this processing. We do not use your photographs to train AI models. Refer to our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more details on data handling.</p>
